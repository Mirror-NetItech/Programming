               Flowcharts are used to design and document simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize the process. <br>
               Two of the many benefits are flaws and bottlenecks may become apparent. 
             </p>
     <p class="p">
     A flowchart is described as "cross-functional" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. <br>
     A symbol appearing in a particular part is within  the control of that organizational unit. <br>
     A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="p">
      Flowcharts represent certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. <br>
      <b style="color: blue">For instance</b>, Kaoru Ishikawa defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the histogram,
      Pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, and the scatter diagram. <br>
      Similarly, in UML, a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the activity diagram, which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams and Drakon-charts are an alternative notation for process flow.
<br>
<b style="color:blue">Common alternative names include:</b> flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process flow diagram, work flow diagram, business flow diagram. <br>
The terms "flowchart" and "flow chart" are used interchangeably. <br>

The underlying graph structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.

           <h4>Let's Uncover The History Behind Flowchart:</h4>
           <p class="p">
             The history of flowcharts can be traced back to the late 19th century, with contributions from various pioneers in logic, mathematics, and computer science. 
             <br>
     <p class="p">
    The first structured method for documenting process flow, the "flow process chart", was introduced by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth in the presentation "Process Charts:  <br>
    First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work", to members of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1921.
    
    </p>
  
    <p class="p">
      The Gilbreths' tools quickly found their way into industrial engineering curricula.  <br>
    In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began to train business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in Lake Placid, New York.<br>
    
Art Spinanger, a 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, took the tools back to Procter and Gamble where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program. <br>
Ben S. Graham, another 1944 graduate, Director of Formcraft Engineering at Standard Register Industrial, applied the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart, to present multiple documents and their relationships.
</p>
<p class="p">

 In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the "ASME Standard: Operation and Flow Process Charts."
</p>
<p class="p">
Douglas Hartree in 1949 explained that Herman Goldstine and John von Neumann had developed a flowchart (originally, diagram) to plan computer programs.
</p>
<p class="p">
 His contemporary account was endorsed by IBM engineers and by Goldstine's personal recollections.
</p>
<p class="p">
The original programming flowcharts of Goldstine and von Neumann can be found in their unpublished report, "Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument, Part II, Volume 1" (1947), which is reproduced in von Neumann's collected works.
<p class="p">
The flowchart became a popular tool for describing computer algorithms, but its popularity decreased in the 1970s, when interactive computer terminals and third-generation programming languages became common tools for computer programming, since algorithms can be expressed more concisely as source code in such languages. <br>
Often pseudo-code is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one.
<br>
In the early 21st century, flowcharts were still used for describing computer algorithms.
</p>
<p class="p">
 Modern techniques such as UML activity diagrams and Drakon-charts can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.

        Flowcharts vary from quickly hand-drawn visualizations to help document or plan a process to comprehensive workflow diagrams created with a designated software. <br>
        To make it easier for you to understand flowcharts across teams, departments, and even industries, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) set official standards in the 1960s, which were adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1970 and are continuously updated and improved. <br> 
        The latest version of this standard was confirmed in 2019.

         <li><b class="phase">Select the right flowchart symbols:</b> Familiarize yourself with the standard flowchart symbols and shapes, including connectors, decision points, and end points. <br>
         Choose the most appropriate symbols based on the type of flowchart you're creating, such as a process flowchart, data flow diagram (DFD), or swimlane diagram. <br>
         Consistency in symbol usage ensures clarity and readability. <br>
         
         <b class="eg">Common flowchart symbols for our program:</b> 
         <table>
           <tr>
             <td><b>Oval :</b></td>
             <td>Start/End</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td><b>Rectangle :</b></td>
             <td>Process step</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td> <b>Parallelogram :</b></td>
             <td>Input/Output</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td><b>Diamond :</b></td>
             <td>Decision point</td>
           </tr>
         </table>
         </li>
     <li><b class="phase">Sketch a Rough Draft:</b> Start with a rough sketch on paper. Place the start symbol at the top, followed by each step in order. <br>
         Connect the symbols with arrows to indicate the flow of the process.<br>
         Clearly mark decision points and show different paths based on possible outcomes.
</li>
<li>
  <b class="phase">Refine Your Flowchart:</b> Ensure that each step is clearly defined and that the flow is logical.<br>
  Remove any unnecessary steps or combine similar steps to make the flowchart easier to understand.<br>
  Make sure all steps, decisions, inputs, and outputs are included.
</li>
<li><b class="phase">Draw/Create the Final Version:</b> Use flowchart software or online tools like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io to create a polished version of your flowchart.<br>
Use the appropriate symbols and add text to describe each step clearly.<br>
Ensure consistent use of colors, fonts, and sizes throughout the flowchart. <br>

So our final flowchart for the simple computer program that calculates the area of a rectangle. <br>
Here we go:
    <div class="flowchart">
        <div class="oval">Start</div>
        <div class="arrow">â†“</div>
        <div class="parallelogram">Input Length (L)</div>
        <div class="arrow">â†“</div>
        <div class="parallelogram">Input Width (W)</div>
        <div class="arrow">â†“</div>
        <div class="rectangle">Calculate Area (A = L * W)</div>
        <div class="arrow">â†“</div>
        <div class="parallelogram">Output Area (A)</div>
        <div class="arrow">â†“</div>
        <div class="oval">End</div>
    </div>
</li>
<li><b class="phase">Implement and Optimize:
</b> Share your completed flowchart with your team members and stakeholders, and encourage feedback. <br>
Collaborate to ensure that everyone understands the process or workflow represented in the flowchart. <br>
Implement the flowchart in your organization and monitor its effectiveness.
Continuously review and optimize your flowchart based on real-world experience and feedback, making adjustments as needed to improve efficiency and productivity.
